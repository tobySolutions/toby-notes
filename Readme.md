# **Notes PWA(Progressive App)**

This project was made for the purpose of understanding how Progressive web apps work in React. Some advantages of PWAs I learnt include:


* Lower Costs: Building a native mobile app or desktop app requires a budget for hiring a developer. But with PWAs, a mobile developer is not needed as a website can be converted straight away into a Progressive Web App,
* Time Saved: A PWA saves time that wouldâ€™ve been spent building a mobile app. The same codebase can be shared across multiple platforms and still look and feel good.
* Lightweight: PWAs are lightweight, not heavy and bulky. This helps the web app have faster loading times and optimum memory utilization.
* Cross-Platform: PWAs are cross-platform. They run in Android, IOS, Windows, and even MacOS, accessible with any device with a browser.
* Fast Update: A Progressive Web App does not need an update to be installed for it separately on any platform it is on. It updates on its own since it technically is a website.
